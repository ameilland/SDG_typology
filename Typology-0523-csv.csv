However, road transport remains the dominant mode of inland road transport remains the dominant mode of domestic transport of goods and people.
Pillar 9: Promotion of tourism - The low level of tourism development results from the poor quality of basic infrastructure and tourist facilities, the poor structuring of the tourist product,  the lack of professional qualification of the personnel of the tourism chain and the absence of specific incentives for investment in the tourism industry.

The development of science and technology has always fostered economic and social transformations as well as societies’ progress. Nowadays, developing countries, including those that lack natural and enormous financial resources, favor this path through a process of scientific and technological innovations.
Our country will bask in a national scientific and technological Pole in order to stimulate creativity and the capacities of innovation and invention of national researchers because “the only wealth is man himself” capable of consolidating the base of development and accelerating progress.

Similarly, the target for nationally defined poverty in 2030 is less than five percent. The MPI is targeted to decline to less than 7 percent in 2030. To address poverty faster at the given income growth on average, the consumption share of bottom 20 percent household is targeted to increase to 12 percent in 2030 from 7.6 percent in 2015. Similarly, social protection expenditure is targeted to reach 15 percent of the federal budget in 2030.;Mentioned;The proposed targets for SDG 2 include reduction in prevalence of undernourishment (measure of sufficiency of access to food at country level) to three percent and prevalence of underweight children under five years of age to nine percent in 2030. The other targets are to reduce the prevalence of anemia among women of reproductive age and children both targeted to reach 10 percent by 2030. The target for per capita food grain production is an increase by at least 66 percent by 2030..;Mentioned;The proposed SDG 3 targets include the reduction of MMR to less than 70 per 100,000 live births by 2030 which is in line with the global target. The child health targets include reduction of preventable death of newborn and children to less than one percent. However, for overall newborn and U5 mortality rates, the target is to reduce them from 23 and 38 per thousand live births to 12 and 20, respectively, by 2030. The other targets include elimination of the prevalence of HIV, TB, Malaria and other tropical diseases, and water borne diseases. Global targets for 2030 are also set to reduce NCDs to one–third of the existing level and to increase health care expenditure to at least 7 per cent from 5 percent of GDP in 2015. The other targets are to increase CPR (modern methods) to 60 percent, raise the proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel to 90 percent, increase institutional delivery to 90 percent and the proportion of women of reproductive age (aged 15-49 years) who have their need for family planning satisfied with modern methods to 80 percent.;Mentioned;The proposed specific targets for SDG 4 include 99.5 percent net enrolment and completion of primary education, and 99 percent gross enrollment in secondary education by 2030. The other targets are to ensure that 95 percent of students enrolled in grade one reach grade eight/ the proportion of youth and adults who have relevant skills (including technical and vocational skills for employment, decent jobs and entrepreneurship) reaches 75 percent/ all youth and at least 98 percent of adults, both men and women, achieve literacy and numeracy/ gender disparities in tertiary education are eliminated.;Mentioned;The proposed specific targets for SDG 5 include elimination of wage discrimination for similar work, elimination of physical/ sexual violence, eliminating all harmful practices, increasing seats held by women in the national parliament to 40 percent, and increasing women’ share in public service decision making positions by nearly three-fold to 33 percent in 2030 from 11 percent of total public service employees.28 The Gender Inequality Index is targeted to decline to 0.05 in 2030 from 0.49 in 2015 while Gender Empowerment Measure is expected to rise to 0.69 by 2030 from 0.57 in 2015.;Mentioned;The proposed specific targets for the year 2030 in SDG 6 include basic water supply coverage to 99 percent of households and piped water supply and improved sanitation to at least 90 and 95 percent of households, respectively. Other targets include the enabling of 98 percent of the population to have access to sanitary latrines;Mentioned;Thus the proposed specific targets for SDG 7 include accessibility of 99 percent households to electricity/ reduction to 30 percent - from nearly 75 percent now - the households who resort to firewood for cooking/ limiting the use of LPG to less than 40 percent of the households/ generation of 15,000 MW of installed capacity/ and per capita electricity consumption increased to 1500 kWh;Mentioned;The global target for 2030 is to achieve per capita GDP growth of at least seven percent. The other targets are to reduce material intensity in manufacturing to 60 percent/ lower underemployment to less than 10 percent/ and to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Alongside, the target is also to increase annual number of jobs in the tourism industry tenfold and to increase the direct contribution of tourism to GDP four-fold. Moreover, the target for access to finance is set at 36 commercial bank branches per 100,000 people by 2030, doubling the current rate of prevalence/ 80 percent of households are targeted to have access to community financial institutions such as cooperatives within 30 minutes of walking distance.;Mentioned;The 2030 target is to increase road density to 1.3 km/sq. km and paved road density to 0.25 km/sq. km. The industrial sector (manufacturing, water and electricity, and construction) suffers from low investment and lack of competitiveness, particularly in manufacturing. Thus the share of industry in total output remains at just 15 percent and this sector employs less than 7 percent of the labor force. The target for 2030 is to increase the share of industry to 25 percent to promote labor intensive activities and raise employment in manufacturing to 13 percent of total employment.;Mentioned;"The proposed specific targets for SDG 10 are set to reducing consumption inequality (index) from 0.33 in 2015 to 0.16 in 2030 and reducing income inequality from 0.46 to 0.23. The Palma ratio is targeted to improve from 1.3 to 1 in the same period. The
targets also include increasing the share of the bottom 40 percent of the population to total income from 12 percent to 18 percent, and increasing the ratio of nominal wage index to consumer price index from 2.94 to 3 in the same period to protect workers from deteriorating real wages.";Mentioned;The 2030 target is to construct at least 60 new satellite cities. The catastrophic earthquake of 2015 damaged 756,000 houses (499,000 fully), 6,063 health facilities and 1,711 other structures. Two thousand nine hundred cultural and religious heritages at least a century old were either destroyed or damaged. For those affected by earthquake, construction of safe housing on government subsidies has begun. The target is to complete the reconstruction by 2020. The 2030 target is to reduce the number of households residing with more than five persons to 20 percent from 47 per cent in 2015. The target is to make at least 50 percent of the highways safe by global standards. The proposed specific targets for 2030 include doubling the proportion of households living in safe houses to 60 percent/ substantially reducing air pollution, preventing the deaths and injuries due to disaster, repairing and reconstructing, by 2020, all cultural heritages destroyed by earthquake, and increasing the budget allocation to the protection of cultural heritage from about 1.15 percent in 2015 to 2 percent by 2030.;Mentioned;Thus, the target for land to be available for cereal production is set at 75 percent of all cultivated land. Currently, consumption of wood per capita is 0.11 m3 per year, and this is proposed to be contained within 0.05 m3 per year. Use of plastic per capita which was 2.7 gram per day in 2015 is proposed to be close to nil. Similarly, the post-harvest loss of food is targeted to reduce from 15 percent in 2015 to less than 1 percent by 2030. The other proposed specific targets for SDG 12 include limiting water use to 20 percent of water resources, limiting fossil fuel consumption to 15 percent of energy consumption, and reducing liquid and solid industrial waste and eliminating of fossil fuel subsidy;Mentioned;The proposed specific targets for SDG 13 include halving the existing CO2 emission level. Climate change adaptation plan is proposed for at least 120 Village Municipalities by 2030. In the meantime, climate smart villages are proposed to increase from zero to 170 and climate smart farming to 500 units from zero at present. Almost all schools will be covered by climate change education.;Mentioned;;Absent;The 2030 target is to maintain the share of protected area at 23.3 of the total land area, increase forest under community management from 39 percent to 42 percent of the forest area, halt forest loss and degradation, increase mountain ecosystem covered by the protected area to 70 percent in 2030, and undertake additional plantation of 5000 hectares each year;Mentioned;The proposed specific targets for SDG 16 include ending death from violent conflict, violence against women, and violence against children, and to improve transparency and accountability scores on globally benchmarked indices. The targets also include eliminating marriage before the age of 18 years, and to have universal birth registration;Mentioned;The targets for revenue collection for 2030 are set at 30 percent of GDP. Domestic government expenditure financed by internal revenue is targeted to reach 80 percent in 2030. The target appears modest because a scaled-up public investment drive to redress critical infrastructure gaps will require large amounts of external resources, in addition to strong revenue collection. To meet the private sector investment financing gap, foreign direct investment (inward stock) needs to multiply at least five-fold from present levels.;Mentioned;;Reconstruction ;Yes;Yes;No detail of the modeling, institutional data

Targets on Anti-Money Laundering";Priority;"Priority 6: Championing investment and business
Priority 8: Re-engaging with the international community

Vision: Fundamentally, this requires a stable macro-economic environment and economic transformation sustained by high productivity levels as pre-requisites
Vision: The resource requirements for re-building the economy are large, hence, the need to prioritise investment, a key ingredient for powering the economy.
Vision: Vision 2030 is anchored on a fiscal policy framework that allows for realisation of Budget savings, supportive of re-orienting expenditures away from consumption towards development
Vision: Domestic investment, both public and private, will benefit from foreign investment inflows in the form of access to capital, technology and markets. Hence, priority is being accorded to engaging the international community at large for investment and technology transfer
Vision: Vision 2030 is, however, conscious that the magnitude of the required resources for economic reconstruction will require augmenting domestic efforts with catalytic bilateral and multilateral financial injections. Hence, Zimbabwe’s quest for final resolution to its external payment arrears. Successful re-engagement with the international community and implementation of a sustainable debt and arrears clearance strategy that will improve the country’s risk profile will be pursued. This will address the current debt overhang challenges, thereby enabling the economy to attract investment and access new lines of credit. This would pave way for review of Zimbabwe’s external indebtedness of over US$11 billion, all with the objective of attaining debt sustainability and access to new financial flows
